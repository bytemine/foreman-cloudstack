# Foreman Cloudstack Plugin

This plugin enables provisioning and managing a Cloudstack Server in Foreman.

## Installation

The only way I can get this to work today is unzipping the source code here on top of foreman or by using the included Vagrantfile. The typical gem installation is what I want to support but does not work yet.

Please see the Foreman manual for appropriate instructions:

* [Foreman: How to Install a Plugin](http://theforeman.org/manuals/latest/index.html#6.1InstallaPlugin)

The gem name is "foreman_cloudstack2".

## Compatibility

| Foreman Version | Plugin Version |
| ---------------:| --------------:|
| >=  1.7         | 0.1.0          |

## Latest code

You can get the develop branch of the plugin by specifying your Gemfile in this way:

    gem 'foreman_cloudstack', :git => "https://github.com/bytemine/foreman-cloudstack.git"

## Limitations

Only advanced networking is supported

All user data is gzipped
